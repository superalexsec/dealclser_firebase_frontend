Subject: Investigation Request: GET /v1/contract-template/ Returning 404 Not Found

Hi Contract Service Team,

Following up on our integration work:

We've successfully configured the Tenant Service to use the `CONTRACT_SERVICE_URL` (the previous 503 error is resolved).

However, when the Tenant Service makes a `GET` request to your endpoint at `https://contract-service-804135020956.us-central1.run.app/v1/contract-template/` (using the correct `X-Tenant-ID` header), your service is returning a `404 Not Found` error.

Could you please investigate the implementation of the `GET /v1/contract-template/` endpoint on your end?

Please check:
*   If the route `/v1/contract-template/` is correctly defined in your router configuration.
*   If the handler function for this route is correctly implemented and deployed.
*   Any relevant logs within the Contract Service that might indicate why this specific path is resulting in a 404.

Let us know what you find.

Thanks,
Tenant Service Team
